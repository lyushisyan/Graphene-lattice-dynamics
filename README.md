# Graphene-lattice-dynamics

The program is designed to calculate the dispersion curves and heat capacity of graphene and graphene nanoribbons taking into account quantum-size effects. The algorithms used are based on the analysis of crystal lattice oscillations in the harmonic approximation using the model of force constants of the four nearest neighbors. The phonon dispersion is determined from the numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem for the dynamic force matrix, and the heat capacity is determined using Bose-Einstein statistics. The result of the program is a family of dispersion curves and the density of phonon states depending on the oscillation frequency, as well as the heat capacity of graphene and graphene ribbons of different widths depending on the temperature. The program can be used by specialists in solid state physics and materials science to model the properties of phonons in graphene and graphene nanoribbons.
